This directory contains the access points for a lot of experiments within Geodesy_Modeling.  For better or worse, it's somewhat research code mixed with library code, because I wanted to have a record of the clever things I was doing with this library.  Each driver here is likely taylored to a specific project.  

For now, this directory is on my system path.  For better or worse.
